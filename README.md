## Game

From the Shadows is a cooperative puzzle platformer game where players have to work their way through a mysterious mansion by resolving puzzles that revolve around the mechanics of Light and Shadow. 

The two players will quickly realize that they are not welcome in this castle when they are struck by a mysterious curse. They will have to join forces to escape, despite the hostility of the occupants of the premises.

A solo game mode is also available to venture alone in the castle, where you can only rely on yourself to make it out alive.

## About us

From the Shadows is a game created by our team of students at Lyon 2 University in France, for the 2020 Gamagora Game Show.
